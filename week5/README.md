# Week 5: Kubernetes

## What will I learn?
- What Container Orchestration is
- What Kubernetes is and isn't
- How to create an AWS EKS Kubernetes Cluster using Terraform
- How to deploy your applications into the cluster
- How to interact with the applications in the cluster
- Basic networking between applications in the cluster
- Some essential `kubectl` commands and Kubernetes configurations

## What should I learn on the weekend?

The materials listed below are meant to be concise, simplified and easy to digest so that we can gently introduce Kubernetes:

- Container Orchestration
  - [[Article] What is container orchestration and why it is needed](https://opensource.com/life/16/9/containing-container-chaos-kubernetes) (**~5 mins**)
- Kubernetes Overview
  - [[Docs] Overview of what Kubernetes is and isn't](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) (**~10 mins**)
  - [[Video] The Illustrated Children's Guide to Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ht22ReBjno) - Not really for children, just a fun video that introduces the essential concepts of Kubernetes (**~9 mins**)
  - [[Video] Overview of Kubernetes Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C_SCDbUJTg) (**~20 mins**)
  - **OPTIONAL** [[Article] Overview of Kubernetes Architecture](https://rtfm.co.ua/en/kubernetes-part-1-architecture-and-main-components-overview/) - For people who prefer to read rather than watch a video (**~20mins**)
  - **OPTIONAL** [[Hands-on] Interactive tutorial on the basics of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) - From "Create a Cluster" to "Update Your Application" (**~2 hours**)
    - If you are short on time, you may read through each lesson's write-up to get the conceptual understanding, but you will miss out the practice on using kubectl commands

- Understanding k8s Pods and Services
  - [[Docs] k8s Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview) **(~5 mins**)
  - [[Video] Breakdown of a Pod spec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6E2yzlEX0Q&t=82s) (**~7mins**)
  - [[Docs] Breakdown of a Deployment spec](https://devopscube.com/kubernetes-deployment-tutorial/) **(~7 mins**)
  - [[Article] k8s Services Explained with Diagrams](https://medium.com/swlh/kubernetes-services-simply-visually-explained-2d84e58d70e5) (**~10 mins**)
  - **OPTIONAL** [[Video] k8s NodePort Service Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lzUpDtmWgM) - A good step by step explanation of the NodePort Service type (**~14 mins**) 
  - **OPTIONAL** [[Docs] Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) - Detailed information about everything else that k8s Service can do (**~30mins**)
