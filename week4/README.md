# Week 4: 
We have talked about deploying your program to AWS in the past two weeks. We have also used the capabilities of the cloud in scaling your application and the basic concepts associated with cloud providers. 

This week, we will talk about containerization to ensure our applications run across platforms, e.g. your IDE and the cloud reliably and consistently. We will also learn how to best utilize available infrastructure resources.

## What will I learn?
1. Introduction to Containerization
   * History of containers
   * Why Containerization:
   * Dependency isolation 
   * Portability
   * Efficient resource utilization
2. Introduction to Docker
   * Defining your container using Dockerfile
   * Building and publishing docker images (via pipeline)

## What should I learn on weekend?
1. [Overview The History of Containers](https://medium.com/@jessgreb01/)
2. [Understanding Containers](what-is-the-difference-between-a-process-a-container-and-a-vm-f36ba0f8a8f7)
3. [Getting started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
4. [An Introduction to Containers - deep dive into container internals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK5i-N34im8)

## What will we do in Guild?
1. Write Dockerfiles to containerize our application jar with different java version or runtime.
2. Modify our setup to build and push docker images versus deploying jar directly on AWS

## What if I want to know more!?
1. Deep Dive into Docker: [The Docker Book](https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Book-Containerization-new-virtualization-ebook/dp/B00LRROTI4) - written step-by-step for system administrators, operations staff on
