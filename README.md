# Introduction

## Infrastructure Implementation Developer

[Infrastructure Implementation](https://capable.herokuapp.com/archetypes/infrastructure-implementation) is one our target capabilities for SEA. 

Infrastructure Implementation Developer is a person/s in the team who implements dynamic infrastructure defined as code, using agile engineering practices, as well as ensure infrastructure meets functional and cross-functional requirements including availability, performance, security, and compliance. 

In this program, we plan to groom our people into Infrastructure Implementation Developers so that they have enough breadth with basics to be able to contribute in a project for Infrastructure related stores right away and be able to deep dive into more about specific topic further themselves.

### Infrastructure 101 Pathway

So, we should now be on the same page around intention of this program. Let's define a minimum set of capabilities we need for becoming a Infrastructure Implementation Developer!

We will use this list of capable competencies required for Infrastructure Implementation archetype as a baseline and we will focus on a few of them.
The goal here is to move from No experience to Learning stage in the selected key competencies.

> **Learning**
>
> Novice, apprentice. Trying to learn fundamentals via self-guided learning, support from a coach/mentor/teammates or other learning resources. Starting to apply new knowledge in a professional setting by working from a checklist or playbook.

## How are we going to do it?

This program will last for 8 weeks. 

Each week we are going to ask you to do some homework beforehand (Maximum 2-4 hrs), and then we will have weekly Infrastructure guild on Wednesday evening where we hack together to practice what we learned by following pre-planned exercises together.

Below is the high level timeline for each week.

* Week 1:  Linux concepts and learn about virtual machines (VMs) and immutable infrastructure.
* Week 2: Cloud Computing, AWS basics, IaC basics
* Week 3: AWS deep(er) dive, Networking
* Week 4: Containerisation and Docker
* Week 5 : Container Orchestration and Kubernetes
* Week 6 : Helm
* Week 7 : CD Pipelines, GoCD
* Week 8 :
